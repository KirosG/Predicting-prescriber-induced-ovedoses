    "The public health data was extracted from [CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/). Downloading data from wonder requires the signing f online conscent and querring the needed information separately and the system will generate the text versions and i have extracting individually for the text versions the deaths associated with opiods. I noticed some anomalies when extracting data from Wonder in large due to the system or functionality of wonder tool they have to group the needed data based on the querry.  The opiods related with Drug enforcement Agency (DEA) licensed specialities connected with the opiods were downloaded from FDA and cross matched with the 2013-2016 Opiods drusglist for the year 2013-2016 can also be accessed [here](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/OpioidMap.html). The Part D Prescriber PUF file was sas version and in texti downloaded into individual tab separated text files as dowloading the 3.2GB data at once and extracting needs significant processing power besides I noticed some anomalies when extracting data from Wonder in large due to the system or functionality of wonder tool they have to group the needed data.

In particular, in this note book i will use the Exploratory Data Analysis(eda) in order to understand the statistical structure of the data. Furthermore, in the following notebooks i will build a predictive machine learning model to predict a certain target variable (prescribers) from other attributes that are linked with the features that i will learn from the eda. The datasets are collected from a real world datasets currently available  and they contains a substantial amount of missing values. In this notebook, i will try to set up  my datasets in note book 1.1 and in 1.2 i will cean all the datasets that i will use in the future and try to understand their relationships and in the next notebook. In Notebook 1.3  i will visualize the most important features and associated ones based on the data collected  that will be used for the next work. All the datasets were collected from different sources and validated. Somedatasets are official querried from respective government institutions using private usercode and adjusted to the subject after cleaning."
